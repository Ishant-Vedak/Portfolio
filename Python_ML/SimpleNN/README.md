# Project Overview:

This project is to help me learn how to use PyTorch for deep learning by creating a simple neural network. I used the playlist from [Codemy.com on youtube](Link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtpcgR9LEYSdi9r7XIbpkpK1&si=hTViaIs3t68OE1ug).

## What I learnt: 

- Basics of a Neural Net and creating one with PyTorch, including how to make the neural net clas and terminologies associated with deep learning (hidden layers within the neural network, loss functions, optimizations, setting the manual seed).
- What are tensors and how to use them.
- How to use the train test split from scikit, and understanding how to set up the variables.

## Features: 

- Uses the Iris dataset to train a simple neural network on flower classification. 
- Splits the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
- After training, the model evaluates how accurately it can predict the species of an iris flower based on unseen data.
- Includes code for saving and loading the trained model for future use.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- PyTorch (framework)
- Pandas (library)
- Matplotlib (libary)
- Scikit-learn (library)

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install torch pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Run the script:
    Python simple_nn.py
