# Overview:

This folder contains three mini projects that are supposed to familiarize me with the pandas library, matplotlib library and the seaborn library in Python. All the csv files were generated using ChatGPT. This also helped me understand the basics of a Jupyter notebook. 

## First Mini Project: MovieRatingsVisual:

This project analyzes the IMDb Top 1000 Movies dataset to explore how average movie ratings vary across different genres. By cleaning and transforming the dataset, it visualizes the mean IMDb rating per genre using a simple bar chart.

The goal is to identify which genres generally receive the highest and lowest average ratings, offering quick insights into audience preferences based on IMDb data.

## Second Mini Project: Sales Dashboard:

This project visualizes the relationship between units sold and revenue using a scatter plot. It helps identify sales trends — for example, whether higher sales volumes correspond to higher revenue, or if there are outliers where the relationship doesn’t hold.

## Third Mini Project: Weather Chart: 

This project visualizes temperature changes over time for three major U.S. cities — Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York — using a fake weather dataset. The goal is to compare how temperatures fluctuate across different locations and identify general trends or patterns.
